# Bethany Ryalls - Portfolio Website

## Description

A responsive personal portfolio website built with HTML and CSS.

The following are the goals of the project:

1. When the page is loaded the user is presented with my name, an avatar photo and information about me.
2. When a link in the navigation is clicked the page scrolls to the corresponding section.
3. The work section contains titled images of my applications.
4. The first application's image should be larger in size than the other applications.
5. When the page is resized or viewed on various screens the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport.
